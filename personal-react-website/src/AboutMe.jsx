        Hi! My name is Soham Kundu, and I am an 18-year-old computer engineering student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Growing up, I loved playing soccer and ultimate frisbee. Though I stopped competing in these sports after graduating from Eagan High School, I remain an integral part of both games by officiating them every summer. While these positions are unrelated to my field of study, I believe they hold immense value, as I regularly make impactful, game-changing decisions in high-pressure, fast-paced environments.

                <br />


        At university, I am deeply exploring the intersection of hardware and software, as I believe there is immense untapped potential in this field. I have built numerous software projects and one hardware project, all of which are showcased below. Of these projects, I definitely enjoyed the JetBot—the hardware project—the most, and I plan to do more in the near future.

        In the summer of 2024 I worked as an AI Trainer/Evaluator at Outlier AI, fully remote. In this role, I contributed to the development of cutting-edge AI models through rigorous data labeling and evaluation. I provided feedback on model performance, meticulously finding areas for improvement and suggesting optimizations, while utilizing advanced tools and platforms to analyze large datasets.

        <br />

        As I grow in this field, I aim to expand my skill set to include C and C++, which are crucial for low-level hardware programming. Additionally, I am working on other hardware projects involving mini-computers like the Raspberry Pi 4. I also plan to utilize my 3D printer more, the Creality Ender 3 V2, to design and print various functional items. I aspire to secure a Co-op engineering or Software Engineering (SWE) internship, to gain experience for a full time job.

        Outside of pursuing my career, I enjoy staying active, whether it's playing soccer or ultimate frisbee casually or weightlifting. I also love reading, as it allows me to gain new perspectives on a variety of topics. My other hobbies include hanging out with friends, playing poker, and running.        </div>
